The goal of the experiment is to express the process of logical deduction of the test paper by computer, thereby realizing the automatic test paper function. The experiment uses genetic algorithms in artificial intelligence to describe the process of automatic collation. The test criteria for the automatic test paper model include the test paper difficulty, the test time, and the test paper discrimination. This constitutes the evaluation function of the test paper Y=f ( test paper difficulty) to judge the quality of the test paper. When generating a set of test papers, the user sets various constraints according to the requirements, and these constraints are finally converted into the evaluation function Y. Certain conditions are used to judge the relative proximity of the test paper generated by the judgment to the target, thereby calculating the relative quality of a test paper.
