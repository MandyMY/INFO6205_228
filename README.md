# Paper Builder

Group 228

The goal of our project is to build a paper using random questions with an ideal difficulty by Genetic Algorithm. When generating a paper, the user sets various constraints (question types, difficulty, question amounts and so on) according to the requirements, and these constraints are finally converted into the evaluation function. Certain conditions are used to judge the relative proximity to the target of the test paper generated by the program, thereby calculating the relative quality of a test paper.
